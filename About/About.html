                    Code For Palestine
                    Code for Palestine was born in 2015 out of a desire to teach coding and entrepreneurial skills to
                    some of the brightest high school students throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The organization
                    funding the initiative, the PalTel Group Foundation [PGF], recognized that there weren’t enough
                    students graduating from Palestinian universities in STEM fields, and those that were graduating
                    lacked some of the critical skills needed to succeed in the private sector. Most importantly, PGF
                    saw an opportunity for a tech-driven startup scene to help tackle some of Palestine’s problems, and
                    realized that a culture of entrepreneurship needed to be bred in order for a startup culture to
                    blossom.Code for Palestine is a three year-long program, beginning the summer before 10th grade and
                    concluding after 12th grade. Each year has many in-person sessions but is kicked off by a two-week
                    camp held during the summer. Volunteer undergraduate instructors from Stanford University have
                    served as the primary teachers during the two-week summer camp.

                    The overarching goals of Code for Palestine are to:

                <ul>

                    <li>Drive interest in computer science & STEM careers.</li>
                    <li>Build critical thinking and design thinking skills to complement coding education.</li>
                    <li>Provide mentorship for promising Palestinian students, with an emphasis on including female and
                        underprivileged students.</li>
                    <li>Encourage entrepreneurship by teaching the skills needed to develop an idea.</li>
                    <li>PGF believes that its support of Code for Palestine will ultimately lead to a more robust and
                        sustainable technology sector in Palestine, driving up employment and wages.</li>

                </ul>
